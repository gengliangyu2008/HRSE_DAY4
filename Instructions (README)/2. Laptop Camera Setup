These instructions are required only if you are using Virtual Box, to allow you to use your webcam on the Virtual Machine. If you are using dual boot, please skip these steps.

cd c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox

2. Next, type the following to list the available cameras

VBoxManage list webcams

Take note of the camera that you desire to use (e.g. .1 or .2, etc)
Normally if only one camera, then the value should be .1

3. Next, type the following to attach webcam(s) you want to use on your Virtual Machine.

VboxManage controlvm "Ubuntu 16.04" webcam attach .X
The "Ubuntu 16.04" should be the name of the VM box env in VM Box Manager

### Change "X" to the camera no. that you are using! ###

*Note that you have to attach the webcam(s) each time you boot your Ubuntu system on the virtual machine

4. You may check if the procedures are done properly by searching on Ubuntu for Cheese Webcam Booth application; open it and see if your webcam can be used
